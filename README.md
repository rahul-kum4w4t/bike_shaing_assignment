# Project Name
> Building the model to predict the affect of rental bike sales.


## General Information
* One Bike Company aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.


## Conclusions
Price and marketing are such variables which directly relates to bike rental but those variables are not present in the dataset. So, we can look for variables which can be controlled to have indirect impact on rent price and marketing which can be “weather” and “temperature”.
- When temperature increases then customers (demand) increase, so increase the rental price at that time.
- When the weather is clear then increase the rental price and when whether is bad decrease it.
- Specially in spring season decrease the rental price because in that season bike sale decreases.
